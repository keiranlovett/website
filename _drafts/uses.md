I play a lot of Apple Music through my first-get HomePod. It's terrible at everything except being a speaker for Apple Music. Many complaints but none for office 'radio'.


# Development

Taking autocompletion and other IDE features out of the picture, Sublime Text is still my favorite editor. 



# Productivity

I'm a day one upgrader of MacOS, so I'm always using the latest version. I also sometimes dare to use beta versions of MacOS when people are saying it's stable enough. In my [dotfiles repo]() you'll find my custom MacOS settings.

My main browser is Safari. I value its low footprint and sync with my other devices, despite being the weakest of the bunch when it comes to devtools. When I occasionally need more advanced tooling, I switch to Chrome.
