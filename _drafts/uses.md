# Development

Taking autocompletion and other IDE features out of the picture, Sublime Text is still my favorite editor. 

# Productivity
My main browser is Safari. I value its low footprint and sync with my other devices, despite being the weakest of the bunch when it comes to devtools. When I occasionally need more advanced tooling, I switch to Chrome.
