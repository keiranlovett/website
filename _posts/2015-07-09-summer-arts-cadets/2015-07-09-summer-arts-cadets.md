This summer, the Hong Kong Museum of Art and The Friends of the Hong Kong Museum of Art co-organised a programme on electronic game design for secondary school students, in partnership with SCAD Hong Kong. I was selected to help teach students games and the state of the industry through a two-week intensive workshop.
