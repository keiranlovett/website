Hey future game creators! If you're gearing up for a game jam, get ready for an exciting rollercoaster of creativity and fun. Here are some super-friendly tips to help you shine at your first game jam:

Some of these tips may seem like common sense, but it is amazing how many times I have had to reiterate them all.

### 1. Get to Know Git:
Before the big day, take a quick peek at Git. It's like a magic spell for sharing and saving your game progress amongst peers - something especially handy when so many people are working on a game at once. Don’t worry if it looks too complicated at a first glance. While there's a lot to depth and complexity to version control tools, for a basic jam you can start to get comfortable with the  `push`, `pull`, and `fetch` commands. There's also easy to use software like Github Desktop that wraps it all up in a user friendly tool.

### 2. Team Up and Team Manage:
Join forces with your pals but remember, teamwork needs a manager too. Have someone keep an eye on everything, like a game guardian. It keeps chaos away! They key to success here is to remember that a manager isn't calling the shots though, the role is to help people collaborate and ensure no one is getting lost on the way.

### 3. Finish Early, Cheer Loud:
Try wrap up the game a few hours before the jam is scheduled to finish. Hitting the finish line a bit early is like doing a victory dance. It not only feels amazing but lets everyone play your awesome creation. Besides there's always some technical difficulty towards the end so buffering things helps a lot!

### 4. Make New Game Friends:
Take breaks to chat with others. Swap socials and exchange ideas. Networking is like planting seeds; they grow into cool opportunities!

### 5. Sleep is a Superpower:
Don’t be a night owl for the entire 48 hours. Power naps at the start mean you'll be a gaming wizard when things get tricky. My personal technique is to sleep the first night and then pull a 24 hour after.

### 6. Keep it Super Simple:
Start with the basics. Don't try to build a virtual universe in one day. Keep it simple, and your game will still be epic!

### 7. Play Your Game, Fast:
Rapidly test your game. The faster you play, the quicker you'll find out what's fun (or not). It’s like tasting a dish—you want to know if it's yummy ASAP!

### 8. Easy Quit and Restart Buttons:
Make sure your game has some basic UI, even just quitting the game makes it a lot easier to test.

### 9. GDD Supervisor – Your Game Guru:
Let one team member be the game guru. They focus on the must-haves and cut out the extras. Think of it like a game plan coach, steering the team in the right direction.

### 10. Celebrate Small Wins:
Every little achievement deserves a mini party. Celebrate the small stuff—it keeps spirits high and makes the journey more awesome.

Game jams are like your personal game-making adventure. Follow these tips, and you'll be rocking the game jam scene in no time! May the game-making force be with you!
