F8, the annual Facebookâ€™s event intended for software engineers and entrepreneurs was a great opportunity for Shadow Factory. Due to our work on the growing "AR Studio" (now called Spark AR) platform, we were invited to participate and sit down with Mark Zuckerberg. Studio Partner, Devin Ehrig and I went down to the McEnery Convention Center in San Jose in to meet more of the Facebook team (and get some free Oculus Go).
