In June 2016, the Chinese government&#39;s censorship body [SAPPRFT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_Administration_of_Press,_Publication,_Radio,_Film_and_Television) announced some big changes for mobile game publishing in China. Starting July 1, 2016, every game will require pre-approval in order to be published on the Chinese market.

While independent developers can handle the approval process on their own, the process may end up paying third-party firms over $5,000USD.

Launching a foreign-developed mobile game in China is impossible without a Chinese publishing partner, as foreign entities, WFOEs, and JVs are prohibited from engaging in online publication activities. Chinese laws and regulations require foreign developers or publishers to engage a qualified Chinese publishing entity to handle and take full responsibility for governmental approvals, game distribution and operation as well as the collection of payments (only Chinese entities are able to receive payment) and user data.

List of approved games: [http://www.gapp.gov.cn/govservice/1980.shtml](http://www.gapp.gov.cn/govservice/1980.shtml)

Process:

The SAPPRFT has publication requirements with different approval processes for three categories of games:
1. Simple games 
  - TIME FOR APPROVAL: At least 20 working days
  1. Do not have any political, military, national, or religious content
  2. Game plot is very simple or game has no storyline
  3. Domestic game classified as match-3, endless runner, flying, chess, puzzle, sports, dance, music, or similar genre
2. Other domestic mobile games
  - TIME FOR APPROVAL: 3 Months
3. Foreign mobile games 
  - TIME FOR APPROVAL: Unspecified, but more than 3 months

All games must not have anything that:
- violates China&#39;s constitution
- violates China&#39;s policy on religion by promoting cults or superstitions.
- threatens China&#39;s national unity, sovereignty, or territorial integrity.
- harms public ethics or China&#39;s culture and traditions.

### App Checklist: 
In order to get your game approved you will need to submit your game at least 20 days or 100 days prior to launch (depending on the process category), with an estimated 7 working days for auditor assessment, upon personal approval, auditor will then send a written letter of recommendation to the SAPPRFT office who will make a final approval, taking an additional 10 working days, before the notification process which averages 3-5 working days.

Within 7 days of the game launch you have to contact SAPPRFT again to report details on the launch of the game, such as the launch date, which app stores it is on and other.
