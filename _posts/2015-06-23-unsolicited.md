I’m a hardcore Bungie fan, they’re the studio that made me want to become a professional game designer. While I still love Destiny, I feel like Bungie could have done much more exciting things to sell us the concept of “a dynamic and social world”. Bungie’s pretty well known as dreaming big and missing a lot of ideas the first time, so I have high hopes for whatever Destiny 2 is. However here’s a few “wishlist” ideas I’d personally love to see in further iterations.

===

#### - Huge Worlds
Each major instalment includes all the content of previous instalments. We have no idea what Destiny 2 will be but I’m hoping that in addition to new Patrol Spaces we gain, we also retain the original spaces from Destiny 1.0. They’re amazing spaces and if future iterations of the game lacks them it would be perplexing within the lore of the game for the player to never visit them again.

#### - A Wild Xur
A procurer of exotic loot, the ease at which it takes to find Xur and obtain exotics doesn’t seem to match up with the status Exotics should hold. Xur is always present in the social hubs at a few consistent locations. In Destiny 2, Xur is exiled from the Tower instead the NPC can only be found in the public spaces of the cosmodrome etc. This presents the player with more of a challenge, as well as further incentive to explore these Patrol Spaces.

#### - Patrol Camps
Within the lore of Destiny its a bit odd that the Vanguard doesn’t have a stronger presence in the Patrol Spaces - we see other players running around, beacons left by others…and lots, and lots of enemies. Instead of having one singular spawn point for Patrol Spaces, Destiny 2 would have multiple spread around the playable zones (making it easier to get to exact locations). These would just be a pile of crates however, but small camps, styled with NPC’s stacking things similar to Dragon Age: Inquisition. This, in my opinion would help solidify the concept that the Vanguard are trying to take back these places and not just a place for Guardians to find loot. 

#### - Public Vignettes
Bungie’s first public gameplay of the Cosmodrome featured a public event that started with a Fallen Ketch appearing out of nowhere knocking over numerous launch pads. It was a dramatic and awesome sight…and sadly a one time cinematic that only occurred in the campaign and for sensible reasons - it altered the game world. While these Patrol Spaces have public events with some dynamic gameplay, Destiny 2 should have what for simplicity I call “vignettes”. These are similar cutscenes to what occur within the campaign but are set up in such a way they don’t impact the game world. While patrolling the Fallen controlled Cosmodrome a Public Vignette would occur, a Fallen Ketch jumping out of warp and flying by in the distance while cannons fire at it from afar. This would help sell the players the agency of the environment again - showing the larger picture of whats going on in these areas of the worlds. Which leads to my next thing…

#### - Dynamic Environments
With each new DLC the Patrol Spaces introduce great new enemy encounters. What if Destiny 2 took this a step further by changing the already existing environments. We see new craters, destroyed ships and Devil Walkers littered around the landscape each week a month before DLC is introduced as part of the lead-up. Destiny is constantly sold to us as a dynamic world…yet the actual environment rarely changes.

#### - Interactive Environments
I would love to see more environments with “Hold X to active ____”, not so much for opening doors but turning on other things like lights and machinery and other dynamic elements. Simple but these go a long way in selling the interactivity of worlds.

#### - Community Test Environments / Public Testing Servers
I’m loving how more and more games are creating places for this to test the more experimental / game breaking features of games - not only does it prevent game breaking changes from disrupting the complete player base but fosters a healthier conversation between the developers and community. With the outrage each new tweak introduces Destiny would benefit from something like this greatly.

#### - In-game Fire Team Message Boards
Bungie has told us again and again how they don’t want matchmaking for Raids etc, and I can see their point and agree to a degree. However there will always be players (like myself) who just don’t have enough friends online to matchmake on our own. Hell, from the studio who basically invented the party system and formed xbox live into the beast it is today single-handedly it seems ridiculous that we need to go outside of Destiny to form fire teams. A concept of the top of my head would be to have a vendor in the tower where players can do and announce that they are looking for players to do these activities with. Destiny’s core UI (with its cursor) already fits this concept perfectly. The player goes to a “Frame” NPC, selects if they want to find or create a group. If they want to find a Fire Team they’re presented with a list of other players across the Tower instances looking for other players. If they want to create a Fire Team they than get a few simple options such as Mic, Min. Lvl, Class etc.

#### - Bounties 2.0 or Boasting
In the Fable series players could boast before the embarked on quests, if they completed events in term with how they boasted they got greater rewards. Destiny is a game about collecting the most badass gear, and showing it off to other players. What if at the Tower a player could boast about their skill before they did an activity - if they live up to the claims of their boast they’re guaranteed to get loot at end of the activity (so long RNG woes). This also gives you another social feature to kill time with in the Tower.
