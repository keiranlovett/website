As I help to startup the new games studio **LKF Labs** within one of Hong Kong's biggest entertainment and lifestyle companies **Lan Kwai Fong Group**, I wanted a means for easily communicating what goes into making a game.

To do this, I designed the **Game Production Pipeline** you see below — a visual blueprint that maps the entire lifecycle of a game across **Art, Design, Development, Production, Marketing, QA, and Release**.

Designing this I tried to make it so the pipeline wasn't just a timeline. I wanted this to be a **communication tool** for explaining the intricacies of the production process to my peers with little understanding of games development. It’s a **shared language** for how cross-disciplinary teams ideally work, ensuring that artists, designers, engineers, and producers all understand where their contributions fit and how dependencies flow between teams.

## Why This Matters

In any studio, but especially a new one, there’s a risk of misalignment between creative vision and delivery. By breaking the process down into **pre-production**, **production**, **post-production**, **QA**, and **release**, this framework:
- **Defines clear ownership** of tasks at each stage
- **Makes handovers** between teams more predictable
- **Highlights critical milestones** and dependencies
- **Helps balance** creative iteration with production deadlines

and more...

## How It’s Structured

The workflow is designed as a layered **Gantt-style chart**:
 - **Horizontal bands** represent disciplines (e.g., Art, Design, Marketing).
 - **Color-coded blocks** represent key tasks and deliverables.
 - **Sequential flow** shows when tasks start, overlap, and hand off.

This should hopefully quickly show to anyone **where we are in the pipeline** and **what’s coming next**.

## Beyond a Chart (Update 2025)

Over the years, this guide has garnered attention from **academics, students, and indies**. That’s been rewarding — but also humbling — because looking back, I can see the gaps that come from having built this early in my career.  

When I first made this, I was **fresh out of university**, with experience at two studios and a strong desire to make the process *make sense* for anyone outside the dev trenches. Today, after leading another startup and working as a producer in **AAA at two studios**, I have a clearer view of how pipelines need to adapt under different production realities.

If I were to rebuild this for **AAA-scale development** today, I’d make several changes:

#### **Live Service Integration**
The original chart assumes a traditional boxed-product release. Modern pipelines need an extended **Post-Launch** phase for content drops, live ops, monetization adjustments, and community-driven updates.

#### **Agile & Milestone Hybrids**
AAA production often blends agile iteration for feature teams with hard milestone gates for the broader project. The original pipeline makes the mistake of presenting it like a fixed waterfall plan.

#### **Risk & Mitigation Gates**
In bigger studios, greenlight checkpoints, strike team interventions, and scope reevaluations are formalized far more than I originally understood.

#### **Cross-Project Dependencies**
AAA pipelines frequently require integration with shared tech teams (**I worked on a few transversal teams at Ubisoft**) and external outsourcing partners. These dependencies shape the schedule in ways the original chart doesn’t explicitly show.

#### **Marketing & PR Embedded Early**
Marketing isn’t just a post-production step; in larger productions, community building, influencer strategy, and brand positioning start during vertical slice and evolve alongside development.

I still believe the original chart works beautifully as a **teaching tool** and a **starting point** for small-to-mid-sized teams. But the more complex the project, the more the pipeline becomes less about following a **static map** and more about **navigating an evolving ecosystem** of priorities, risks, and opportunities.

For now I'll [just share the working InDesign files...](game-development-pipeline.indd)
