          **G'day! I'm Keiran Lovett**.  
          
          I am an organized game producer with strong skills in leadership, communication, project management, and process design. With over a decade of experience in the Games Industry, I've led both indie and commercial game projects, managing development pipelines, coordinating cross-functional teams, and overseeing all phases from concept to launch. My background spans software development, game design, and user experience, making me a versatile producer who can drive projects to completion while balancing creative and technical goals.
