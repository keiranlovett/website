          **G'day! I'm Keiran Lovett**.  
          
          I am an experienced game producer, working across both indie and AAA over the last decade. With over a decade of experience in the Games Industry I've managed development pipelines, coordinating cross-functional teams, and overseeing all phases from preproduction to post launch on titles. My background spans software development, game design, and user experience, making me a versatile producer who can drive projects to completion while balancing creative and technical goals.
