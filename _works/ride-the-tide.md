As Technical Director for the Hong Kong Windsurfing Teamâ€™s XR experience, I led the vision and execution of a first-of-its-kind multiplayer windsurfing game, seamlessly fusing real-world sport with immersive technology. My team engineered a custom 3m sailing rig, precisely integrated with the VR game through bespoke sensors and control systems, allowing players to physically manipulate a sail and experience lifelike windsurfing in a virtual environment. Overseeing all aspects of hardware-software integration, real-time feedback systems, and multiplayer synchronization, I ensured the experience delivered both technical excellence and intuitive play. Collaborating closely with pro athletes and designers, we translated authentic windsurfing mechanics into code, setting a new bar for tactile, brand-driven VR experiences.
