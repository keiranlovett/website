As producer on the Hong Kong Observation Wheel AR app, I worked with AIA and TGEC to bring a world-first immersive experience to life—right from the heart of Hong Kong’s iconic waterfront. Overseeing the bug fixing, testing, and launch of the app, I led the team in integrating live telemetry from the observation wheel directly into the AR experience, syncing the city’s motion with interactive time-travel journeys in the augmented experience. Riders could explore Hong Kong’s evolution through three distinct eras, watching the cityscape transform in real time as the wheel turned. Guiding cross-disciplinary teams, I helped deliver an experience that blended history, technology, and cultural storytelling—giving visitors the chance to see Hong Kong through a dynamic, augmented lens, and setting a new standard for location-based AR attractions.
