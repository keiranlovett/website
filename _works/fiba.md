As producer on the FIBA World Cup Trophy Tour Fan Portal, I brought a fully immersive, real-time cheering experience to life for basketball fans worldwide. Overseeing development of both the on-site Windows app and the live web portal, I guided the technical team in building seamless video capture and instant upload workflows, allowing fans to record their cheers on location and see them featured online within minutes. We collaborated closely with the Basketball Federation to launch a custom moderation platform that enabled swift content review and approval, ensuring a vibrant, family-friendly mosaic of thousands of cheering fans. The end result was a high-traffic digital showcase that captured the global spirit of the tournament, blending interactive event tech, scalable cloud infrastructure, and unforgettable moments of fan excitement.
