CryptoCarz was an early attemp at a multiplayer, VR racing game being built on the backbone of the Ethereum network by the team at [BlockChain Studios](https://www.blockchain-studios.io/). With every car represented by a [non-fungible token](https://decentraland.org/blog/technology/what-are-nfts/), you would have complete ownership and control over your garage of collectible cars.


Decentraland has recently announced that, along with its ongoing partnerships with [Etheremon](https://www.blockchaingamer.biz/news/6243/etheremon-overtakes-cryptokitties-in-daily-active-users-with-adventure-mode/) and [CryptoBeasties](https://www.blockchaingamer.biz/news/6370/cryptobeasties-begins-its-pre-sale-on-24th-september/), that it is partnering up with the Virtual Reality blockchain game, [CryptoCarz](https://www.blockchaingamer.biz/profiles/4223/what-is-cryptocarz/).
