Working as Product Owner for Singapore Airlines’ flagship AR Kids Experience, I led the creation of a hands-on, kid-friendly platform that blended physical creativity with digital magic. My team and I developed an augmented reality coloring book that allowed children to scan their hand-colored mascots, instantly bringing them to life as vibrant, color-accurate 3D models within a custom mobile app. This project pushed the boundaries of early AR technology and computer vision, with custom Unity and OpenCV pipelines capturing every crayon stroke and translating them into interactive mini-games and multimedia experiences. Partnering closely with Singapore Airlines’ innovation group, I shaped the technical roadmap, championed playful user experiences, and delivered a project that brought cutting-edge tech to young travelers—making every journey a bit more magical.
