While world-leading elevator company Thyssenkrupp operates several physical showrooms globally, the company needed a more nimble and flexible method of sales engagement. Shadow Factoryâ€™s built a VR solution in 2016 during the emergence of VR offering an immersive space that can house interactive representations of its brand, products, services, and R&D approach. Using a backoffice website the tool could easily be updated, modified, and localized for different sale regions. The virtual showroom was rolled out worldwide across all ThyssenKrupp's key markets, to widespread acclaim.

In this project, I was resonsible for the overall architecutre of the VR tool and backoffice systems.
